# Contoso University (aka EF Core with Razor Pages tutorial)

This is my slightly modified version of the [EF Core with Razor Pages tutorial(https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-rp/intro?view=aspnetcore-6.0).
 The differences are mostly cosmetic (code style, a few fixes, etc.).

This version uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) out of the box and needs to be modified to use a different database provider.
